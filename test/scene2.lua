	--
	-- 1. Draw Puzzle (Target) Area -- Place adjacent to the lower-right edge of the screen.
	--
	puzzleArea = display.newRect( 0, 0, 300, 240)

	-- Tip: When we create a rectangle, we place it by its upper-left corner at <0,0>.
	--      However, after a rectangle has been created, the refenence point automatically
	--      changes to its center.
	--      So, in the future when we place it, we are specifying where the CENTER of the
	--      rectangle should be.

	puzzleArea.x = w - 160
	puzzleArea.y = centerY + 35

	-- Make the fill DARKGREY and the outline a THIN LIGHTGREY
	--

	puzzleArea:setStrokeColor( 0.5,0.5,0.5,1 )
	puzzleArea.strokeWidth = 1

	--
	-- 2. Draw Piece Tray -- Take up most of the left side of the screen.
	--
	piecesTray = display.newRect( 0, 0, 140, 140)

	-- Same tip as above on creation, then placement.

	gameStatusMsg = display.newEmbossedText( "Puzzle Solved!", 0, 0, native.systemFont, 36 )

	gameStatusMsg.x = puzzleArea.x
	gameStatusMsg.y = 120

	-- Tip: I created the above text object at position <0,0> and then positioned it.  Why?  Because you have no way of knowing the exact width/height
	-- of a text object till it is created.  So, trying to position it during creation will end up placing it by the upper-left coordinates, and may not be what you wanted.
	-- However, after the text object is created, it changes to a center reference point.  So, by waiting to set the position, we get the result we really wanted.

	gameStatusMsg:setFillColor( 0.1211,0.8633,0.1211 )	-- Make the solved message a nice shade of green.
	gameStatusMsg.isVisible = false			-- Hide it for now.  (The puzzle isn't solved yet!)

--    placePieces() - (Create and) place the pre-sliced puzzle pieces.
-- ==
placePieces = function()

	-- Placing jigsaw pieces is a bit trickier than placing rectangular pieces, because
	-- the pieces generally do not have any (easily calculated) correct positions.
	--
	-- Why?  Because each piece is irregularly, shaped and sized.  Further comlicating things,
	-- each piece may overlap other pieces.  Now, there are ways to regularize this, but my suggestion
	-- is that you not try to programatically solve placment of jigsaw pieces.  Either buy an
	-- algorithm from someone who has, or place the pieces manually and use my technique of later
	-- moving the solved positions to the tray.
	--
	-- Now, having said all of that, the example you are looking at is an exception to the
	-- above rule.  Because this simple puzzle only has four (4) pieces, I can easily place them
	-- simply by setting their reference points to the correct outer edge and placing that piece on the
	-- corner of the 'puzzleArea'.
	--
	-- Follow along carefully now and this should become clear...
	--

	-- Calculate the outer bounds (left, right, top, and bottom) of the 'puzzleArea'
	--
	local left   = puzzleArea.x - puzzleArea.contentWidth/2
	local right  = puzzleArea.x + puzzleArea.contentWidth/2
	local top    = puzzleArea.y - puzzleArea.contentHeight/2
	local bottom = puzzleArea.y + puzzleArea.contentHeight/2

	--
	-- Place Pieces In Solved Positions

	--
	local tmp

		for col = 1, 2 do

		-- Calculate the image number here we are placing.
		--
		local imgNum = row + (col-1) * 2

		tmp = display.newImage( "images/" .. puzzleName .. "/" .. imgNum .. ".png")

		-- Now for the magic, depending on the piece we are placing, set it's reference
		-- point accordingly.
		-- 1 - Top Left
		-- 2 - Top Right
		-- 3 - Bottom Left
		-- 4 - Bottom Right
		--
		-- Then, simply place that piece at the proper pre-calculated position.
		-- 1 - < left, top >
		-- 2 - < right, top >
		-- 3 - < left, bottom >
		-- 4 - < right, bottom >
		--
		-- Viola!

		-- Now, before we record the 'solved' position, set the
		-- piece's reference point back to the middle.

		-- Mark the starting position of each tile after we place it.  This is the 'solved position'
		-- for the tile.

		--
		tmp.isSolved = false

		-- Attach a touch listener to thew newly created and placed tile.
		--
		tmp:addEventListener( "touch", onPuzzlePieceTouch )

		-- Lastly, put a reference to the new tile into the table 'puzzlePieces'
		-- This simply provides an easy way to keep track of the pieces and to iterate
		-- over them later in 'isSolved()'.
		--
		puzzlePieces[#puzzlePieces+1] = tmp

		end
	end

end

-- ==
--    movePiecesToTray() - This function moves the tile pieces created in 'placePieces()' over
--    to the puzzle tray.  (Otherwise the puzzle would be solved already!)
--
--	  This code may look a little complicated but it is pretty simple.  Here is what it does:
--
--    1. It determines an upper (yStart) and lower (yEnd) bound for placing pieces.  Later,
--       no piece will be allowed to have a y position outside this range.
--
--	  2. It starts the first y-position (curY) at the top (yStart)
--
--    3. I then iterates over the pieces and does this:
--
--       3a. Assign a random x-position to the current piece equal to the center x-position of
--       'piecesTray' +/- 20 pixels.
--
--       3b. Assign the y-position as curY
--
--       3c. Mark the piece's 'inTray' position as the new location (i.e. where we just placed it).
--       (This is later used to snap the piece back to its tray position if the user drags the piece
--        and releases it over the tray.)
--
--       3d. Make the piece 20% smaller (by scaling it).  (Not required for functionality, but a nice effect.)
--
--       3e. Randomly rotates the piece a little (+/- 30 degrees). (Again, not required just a nice effect.)
--       (Also, record this rotation (in 'inTrayAngle') so we can re-rotate pieces that get dropped on the tray.)
--
--       3f. Calulate the next y-position by randomly adding from 60 to 100 pixels to curY.  Notice that
--       if curY is then greater than yEnd, it is set back to yStart.  As I said above, this keeps it in
--       our pre-calculated y-boundary.
--
--       Repeat 3a. .. 3f. for each piece.
--
--	  At the end of this process, we will have a nice random looking of down-scaled puzzle pieces over our
--    'piecesTray'.  By using random values the end result is never the same twice which gives a much more
--    professional look to the game.

--    onPuzzlePieceTouch() - This is the touch handler.  It provides the ability to drag-and-drop puzzle pieces
--    from the pieceTray to anywhere on the screen.  It provides these 'special effects':
--
--    1. When a piece is first touched, it will rotate back to 0-degrees and scale back to 100% of its original size.
--       (It also pops to the top of all other pieces so it is on top during the drag.)
--
--    2. Pieces dropped close enough to their solved positions will snap into place and be marked as solved. (Solved
--       pieces are ignored by the touch handler.)
--
--    3. Pieces dropped over the pieces tray will snap back to their 'inTray' position, size, and rotation (angle).
--
--    4. Pieces dropped anywhere else on the screen will simply sit there.  This allows users to drag pieces around and
--       compare them to eachother in order to find the pattern.
--
--    5. At the end of ever (successful) drop, the touch handler will run the 'isSolved()' function to see if the board was solved.
